# cloud-starters-aws

This project demonstrates building and using a custom resource in cloudformation. This implementation of a custom resource wraps a standard lambda with a helper function which does the necessary cfn signalling. Source code for the custom resource lambda and another hello world lambda to use with it are included.

This particular custom resource, file-uploader, might be useful for users who would like to share lambda code bundles publically via a CDN URL rather than directly from a bucket. A consumer of that shared code bundles can use the file downloader custom resource in their cloudformation templates to copy the code bundles(s) from a URL into a private bucket of their choice, and then use this local bucket copy of the code bundle(s) as the source for their lambda installation (remember lambda code bundles still have a requirement to be located in a bucket in the same region as the lambda installation)
